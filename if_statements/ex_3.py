# 4-10. Slices: Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several
# lines to the end of the program that do the following:
# •	 Print the message The first three items in the list are:. Then use a slice to
# print the first three items from that program’s list.
# •	 Print the message Three items from the middle of the list are:. Use a slice to
# print three items from the middle of the list.
# •	 Print the message The last three items in the list are:. Use a slice to print the

# 4-11. My Pizzas, Your Pizzas: Start with your program from Exercise 4-1
# (page 56). Make a copy of the list of pizzas, and call it friend_pizzas.
# Then, do the following:
# •	 Add a new pizza to the original list.
# •	 Add a different pizza to the list friend_pizzas.
# •	 Prove that you have two separate lists. Print the message My favorite
# pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the first list. Print the message
# My friend’s favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the second list. Make sure each new pizza is stored in the appropriate list.
# 4-12. More Loops: All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using
# for loops when printing to save space. Choose a version of foods.py, and
# write two for loops to print each list of foods.
